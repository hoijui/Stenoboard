# Stenoboard wood case

Code that describes a 3D model of an alternative case/base
for the Stenoboard Free Hardware stenography keyboard.
It is intended to be made of wood.

It uses Clojure code that gets translated into OpenSCAD source code,
which in turn can generate STL files which can then be CNC milled.
